Create a README file with the following sections:

Overview
In one paragraph, describe what the repo does

Include a "screenshot" of you uploading your image

For full credit, this should be a short (5ish second) animated gif. If you don't include an animated gif, then the max credit you can get is 15/16.

Build Instructions
Should contain a short description of the commands needed to bring your services up and how to use them
This should be complete enough that anyone can bring the service up
The idea of the README is that this is something you could show off to potential future employers, and so you should polish it accordingly.
